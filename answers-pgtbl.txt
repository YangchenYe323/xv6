1. read() could possibly be faster if kernel can read directly into the shared page
instead of doing a copy from kernel buffer to user buffer.

2. Page 0 contains program text (7 means VALID, READ and EXECUTE), page 2 contains the stack guard, user can read/write memory in page 1, the third to last page contains:
USYSCALL mapped page, trapframe and trampoline.
