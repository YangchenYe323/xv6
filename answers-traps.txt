1. 13 to printf is stored in a2. arguments are stored in a1 and a2
2. They are inlined and statically evaluated to the result 12
3. 0000000000000630, it is jumped by first loading the instruction address of
`auipc ra,0x0` in ra, which is 0x30, and the do a `jalr 1536(ra)`, which jumps to
the instruction located at 0x30 + 0x600 = 0x630, which is printf
4. ra is 0x30, just stored by `auipc ra,0x0`, because ra is saved and restored by
the prinf procedure
